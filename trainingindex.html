<h1>Training Your Pup.</h1>

At about 2 months of age your puppy is only capable of holding its bathroom needs for about 2 hours, but this doesn't mean you sould
wait all that time for your puppy to be able to do his or her business. It is okay to take your puppy outside for only a brief period
of time only for them to relieve themselves. Also make sure that there are no other dogs around before you take them out, since at this 
age they do not have all of their shots. This is very crutial because they will get sick, and can die from these diseases. As their age 
increases they are able to hold their bathroom needs for longer. It is good to establish a routine for your puppy, such as each morning
when you wake up, take the puppy out and wait there until he or she relieves themselves. Also keep a close eye on him or her as they wander,
and explore the outside world. It can be easy for them to pick up foreign objects from the gound, if this does happen try distracting your dog
so that he or she can drop the item, and you can retrieve it. Once the dog has relieved its self, bring it back inside as soon as possible.
Note: your dog may also pick up dirty objects such as another animals feces,but do not be alarmed, as this is all a learning process, for
your little one. Just distract your pet, and remove and dispose of the item, without him or her seeing. Puppies do as you do and will try to 
pick things up like you just by watching you. Try to take your dog out every hour or so to get them associated with relieving themselves outside.
If the puppy goes on the carpet, please remain calm. You will have to grab a training pad, and use that to soak up the urine. You can also take a 
small piece of the feces and place it onto the pad so that he or she will think they relieved themselves there. This will help train your pup to 
use the restroom onto the training pads. If he or she continues to make these mistakes keep trying, if the puppy catches on reward them with praise
and a treat. Once your puppy becomes associated with this technique, it is important that you clean up after it when he or she is not watching. Always
place new training pads down once the dog has soiled themseveral times. You will also start to notice your dogs behavior if he or she feels that even 
going once on the pad is too soiled. Keep in mind that puppies will need to have a bowel movement 15 to 20 minutes after eating.

Step 1: Get a routine started for your pup.
Step 2: Teach him or her to use the training pads.
Step 3: Clean up after your pet, but be discrete, when they are young.
Step 4: Reward them with a treat when they do something you want them to.
