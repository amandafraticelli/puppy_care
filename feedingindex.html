<h1>Feeding Your Pup.</h1>

<p>Puppies need to eat 3 times daily. When they reach 8 months to a year, the owner should only feed them 2 meals a day.
When they become fully grown, it is okay to feed them once a day. It is important that food is always within reach for your
young puppy. If he or she is not fed enough or properly, they could develop deficiency issues, which can lead to nasty habbits.

although good food may be expensive, it is important to consider a healthy diet for your pet. Be sure to check the ingredients
of your pets food before purchasing it, if there are things you cannot pronounce, chances are its not good for your pet.
You should go with a more raw based food for your dog. Also ask around to see which brands are recommended and do some searching.
