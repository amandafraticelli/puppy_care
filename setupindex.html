<h1>Everyone loves puppies, but do you know how to care for them?</h1>


<h1>Setting Up For Your Pup.</h1>

Once you have chosen the puppy, it is important that you establish an area for him or her. Once you choose where this 
area will be it needs to remain that way. It is important that you pick an area where you feel comfortable enough
to leave him or her and where your puppy can roam around safely. The area should enclude, a bed, and feeding bowls, some
additional items can include, training pads, & a crate or dog gate. The bed is important for your dog to be able to retreat
to when he or she is nervous, scared, or confused. Where ever this is set up, it needs to remain permanent, because moving
these items around constantly can stress or confuse your puppy. You must also puppy proof your house, before bringing them
home. It is crutial that you wrap up any loose cords, and pick up any small objects, such as hair clips, pins, etc. If these
items are left lying around, your puppy can injest them, and this is very dangerous. It could also be very costly to you 
and your new furry friend. Another important thing to take note of, is if you have a cat. Dogs & cats can make very good friends
or it can go the oposite, but this is not about friendship. If your cats food is easily accessable for your new pup, you need to 
change this, cats food is very unhealthy for any dogs or puppies, and should not be consumed by any means. IMPORTANT: you must also
be prepared to spend a lot of time with your new furfriend, as he or she will need plenty of attention during its growing process.
You will need to provide a substantial amount of toys for your pup, so that he or she can get used to playing with those instead of
your personal belongings. If you stop showing your puppy attention he or she may do things just to get that attention back, whether
it be good or bad.

Step 1: Puppy proof your home.
Step 2: Establish an area for your puppy.
Step 3: Provide the living needs, which include a bed, bowls & plenty of toys.
Step 4: Separate cats food from the dogs food.
Step 5: Be prepared to give LOTS of attention to your new furfriend.
